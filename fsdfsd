Compare the election promises of Canada’s major parties

Read the policies and promises of the six main parties on the election's pressing issues. These will be updated as parties add to their platforms ahead of the April 28 vote.
Border security
Liberal

The Liberals would train 1,000 new Canada Border Services Agency officers and add new border scanners, drones and K-9 teams to target suspicious shipments at land borders, ports and railyards.
Conservative

The Conservatives have pledged to add at least 2,000 border agents, extend Canada Border Services Agency powers along the entire border and install border surveillance towers, as well as truck-mounted drone systems to spot unauthorized crossings. They would install high-powered scanners at all major land crossings and shipping ports.
New Democrat

The NDP committed to rehiring “every border officer cut by the last Conservative government” to curb the number of illegal guns entering Canada. 
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc wants the federal government to create a border minister to be fully accountable for border control. It would allow border services officers and the RCMP to patrol outside of border crossings. The party would reverse the decision to shorten the hours of operations of border crossings in Quebec. It would recruit more RCMP officers and invest in surveillance at ports and inspections of rail freight transport and would propose tougher penalties for border smugglers. 
Green

The Green Party would ramp up CBSA and CAF patrols and surveillance at the border to protect Canadians, prevent the entry of illegal firearms, drugs and other threats from the U.S. and to dissuade human traffickers.
People's Party

The party has yet to share its campaign promises on this issue, beyond its proposed reforms to immigration.
Climate change, energy
Liberal

The Liberals cut consumer carbon pricing before the campaign. They plan to introduce incentives to help families invest in clean energy, including reinstating the zero-emissions vehicle subsidy program. They would tighten the output-based pricing system for large industrial emitters to ensure carbon markets work properly. They are open to building pipelines and speeding up energy projects. They would allow Quebec to veto any pipeline on its territory. They say they would phase out the use of fossil fuels in government buildings by 2030. They would develop a carbon border adjustment mechanism to tax imports from countries that don’t have comparable carbon pricing. They would invest $20 million to help the Nunavut Nukkiksautiit Corporation complete the first phase of the development of its hydroelectricity facility. They would invest $94 million to upgrade power plants in Cambridge Bay, Gjoa Haven, Igloolik and Iqaluit.
Conservative

Conservatives would repeal all carbon pricing, including on industrial emitters. They would boost incentives (e.g., expand tax credits) for businesses that reduce emissions and to promote clean energy technologies. The party hasn't announced its carbon emissions reduction target, but says it would use the Paris Agreement to export Canadian resources and technology to lower global emissions. The party would also offer a tax incentive for manufacturers who lower emissions. It would support an east-west pipeline and would approve projects such as LNG Quebec. The party would be open to exporting oil from the Port of Churchill and has pledged to speed up development of the port. Conservatives would ban the dumping of raw sewage into waterways and repeal the federal ban on single-use plastics.
New Democrat

The NDP supported the removal of consumer carbon pricing. The party would keep the industrial carbon price. It would introduce a border carbon adjustment mechanism to tax imports from countries that don’t have comparable carbon pricing. The NDP says it would cut “$18 billion in oil and gas subsidies,” but did not specify which. It is against building an LNG pipeline in Quebec and believes the province should have the right to veto energy projects on its territory. The party opposes the Energy East project but isn't shutting the door to pipelines. It would prioritize creating an east-west electricity grid. It would continue the 100 per cent tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles. It would rebate Canadian families and businesses $10,000 for buying or leasing over 12 months a Canadian-manufactured zero-emissions vehicle and $5,000 for buying or leasing a zero-emissions vehicle manufactured elsewhere.
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc wants the federal government to compensate Quebec to the tune of $814 million — a share of the carbon pricing rebate paid out to Canadians after the system was repealed. Quebecers did not receive the rebate cheques because the province has its own carbon pricing system. The party opposes any pipeline project passing through Quebec and wants to end support for offshore oil and gas exploration in marine protected areas. It suggests taxing the profits of oil and gas companies and reinvesting the sums into climate change adaptation initiatives. The party would introduce a border carbon adjustment mechanism to tax imports from countries that don’t have comparable carbon pricing. It would ask the federal government to increase its share of funding for the Canada-Quebec Nature Agreement fund from $100 million to $300 million.
Green

The Green Party would bring in legally binding emissions reductions, aiming to cut emissions by 60 per cent by 2030 and has committed to net zero by 2050. It would invest in an east-west national electric grid. It would respect Quebec's opposition to pipelines. It would remove barriers to inter-provincial energy trade. It would halt all new fossil fuel projects by 2045 and would stop giving public money to oil and gas companies, investing instead in clean energy to deliver 100 per cent renewable electricity to the country by 2035. It would create a new national emergency response agency. 
People's Party

It would abolish all climate change programs. But it would invest in adaptation strategies for floods and forest fires. It would find a buyer for the Trans Mountain pipeline. It would withdraw from the Paris Accord. It would repeal C-48, which regulates vessels that transport crude oil to or from ports or marine installations along B.C.’s north coast and C-69, the federal government’s Impact Assessment Act. It would reassert federal jurisdiction over pipeline construction by invoking section 92(10) of the Constitution if necessary. It would keep Line 5, which runs from Sarnia, Ont. to Michigan and Wisconsin, in operation. 
Cost of living
Liberal

The Liberals say they would trim one percentage point from the lowest income tax bracket. They would also cancel a proposed hike to the capital gains inclusion rate. They would ease access to employment insurance by raising regional unemployment rate percentages and eliminate the GST on all homes up to $1 million for first-time homebuyers. They would suspend rules that prevent people with severance packages from collecting employment insurance for six months. They would increase the guaranteed income supplement (GIS) by five per cent for one year. They would reduce the minimum amount that must be withdrawn from a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) by 25 per cent for one year.
Conservative

The Conservatives say they would drop the tax rate on the lowest income tax bracket from 15 per cent to 12.75 per cent. They would defer capital gains taxes if the proceeds are reinvested in Canada. They would increase the annual TFSA contribution limit by $5,000 a year, provided the money is invested in Canadian companies. The party would remove the GST on new homes sold for under $1.3 million and on Canadian-made vehicles. It promises to allow working seniors with an annual income under $42,000 to earn as much as $34,000 without paying taxes, and let seniors continue to contribute to RRSPs until age 73, rather than the current limit of 71. The party would also allow travelling trades workers to write off the full cost of food, transportation and accommodations. Conservatives have pledged to streamline support for veterans by automatically approving disability applications not processed within 16 weeks and improving access to education and training benefits.
New Democrat

New Democrats pledge to raise the amount of untaxed income from $16,129 to $19,500. The party would eliminate GST on essentials (e.g., energy, internet and mobile phone bills). They would keep the proposed increase in the capital gains tax, reinvesting that revenue in universal pharmacare, improving access to health care, national rent control, new housing and a cap on grocery prices. The party would double the amount of the Canada disability benefit and increase the guaranteed income supplement at a combined cost of $3 billion to $4 billion. It wants to open up more $10-a-day child-care spots. It would increase the EI replacement rate to two-thirds of insurable earnings, with a minimum weekly benefit of $450; extend EI benefits to 50 weeks nationwide; implement a national 360-hour standard to qualify for benefits; and remove the one-week waiting period. It would expand pharmacare, dental care and mental health supports for Canadians and ban U.S.-style private health-care clinics.
Bloc Québécois

The party would table a bill to increase old age security payments for those aged 65 to 74 by 10 per cent and propose tax incentives for seniors who choose to remain in the workforce. It wants the child benefit adapted to blended families and based on the income of the parents who have custody. The Bloc would call for the GST credit to be doubled in quarters when the inflation rate exceeds the Bank of Canada's target (between one and three per cent) and pay it out monthly. The party says it would restrict creditcard interest rates. It would push to cut the GST on all second-hand goods and require a single tax report, which Quebec would administer.
Green

The Greens would raise the amount of untaxed income to $40,000 for people earning less than $100,000. They would create a guaranteed livable income. The party plans to expand paid leave to elder care, people suffering a miscarriage and other family needs. It wants to create universal early learning and child care that every family can afford, although the Green Party has not provided details of how the plan would work. The party has also proposed making college and university free for all through expanded public funding for institutions, cancelling student loan interest and reducing financial barriers to adult learning.
People's Party

It would reinstate the fair disability pension for veterans, as previously provided for by the Pension Act. The pension would apply retroactively to 2006 and lump-sum payments received since then would be treated as advance payments. The party would request a line-by-line review of the New Veterans Charter to assess which policies and programs should be kept, in order to help simplify the system. It would abolish new spending programs by the Trudeau government, such as day care, pharmacare and dental care programs. It would eliminate all other programs that duplicate provincial programs or intrude on provincial jurisdictions. 
Crime, justice
Liberal

The Liberals would shift the burden of proof to the accused to make it harder for people charged with violent car theft, organized crime, home invasions and certain human-trafficking and smuggling offences to get bail. They would upgrade murder charges involving intimate partner violence and sexual violence to a constructive first-degree murder offence and criminalize the distribution of non-consensual sexual deepfakes. They would increase penalties for the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. A Liberal government would recruit 1,000 more RCMP personnel, open a new RCMP academy in Saskatoon and increase pay for cadet recruits. It would increase funding for the Public Prosecution Service of Canada to prosecute drug production and trafficking offences. To protect children from online sexploitation and extortion, a Liberal-led government would raise the maximum sentence for child luring. It would extend how long data related to child sexual offences needs to be preserved and extend the period for these cases to be prosecuted. To tackle hate-related crimes, a Liberal government would introduce legislation to criminalize intentionally obstructing access to any place of worship, schools and community centres. It would make it a criminal offence to wilfully intimidate or threaten those attending services at those sites, and it would increase the annual budget of the Canada Community Security Program.
Conservative

The Conservatives would use the notwithstanding clause, which gives legislatures in Canada the power to override portions of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, to introduce consecutive sentences for offenders convicted of multiple murders. They would put in place a “three-strikes-and-you’re-out” law to make criminals convicted of three offences ineligible for bail, probation, parole and house arrest and give them a minimum sentence of 10 years. They would also designate those criminals as dangerous offenders to prevent their release until they prove they are no longer a danger. It would impose mandatory life sentences on anyone involved in the trafficking, production and distribution of over 40 mg of fentanyl. A Conservative government would create a new offence, “assault of an intimate partner,” to "deliver tougher sentences for anyone who abuses an intimate partner.” It would require strict bail conditions for anyone accused of intimate partner violence, such as mandating the use of GPS ankle bracelet monitoring, “with any breach of conditions resulting in immediate imprisonment.” It would ensure that the killing of “an intimate partner, one’s own child or a partner’s child” would be treated as first-degree murder. If elected, the Conservatives would redirect Canada Revenue Agency resources toward targeting offshore tax havens and create a “name-and-shame” publication to expose corporations evading taxes. The party plans to expand the offshore tax informant program and give whistleblowers up to 20 per cent of the recovered funds when they report illegal tax schemes. Conservatives would pass a Stop Scamming Seniors Act to hold banks and telecom companies accountable for catching scams, introducing a $5-million fine for companies if they do not use the latest technology to stop scams and mandatory jail time and fines to “financially cripple” fraudsters.
New Democrat

The New Democrats would end tax agreements with known offshore tax havens like Bermuda and require corporations to provide a “genuine business reason” for using offshore accounts, in order to prevent tax evasion. If elected, an NDP government would implement public country-by-country financial reporting to prevent multinational corporations from hiding profits.
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc supports harsher sentences for crimes related to intimate partner violence and family violence. It is against federal use of the notwithstanding clause, saying “it hasn’t been conceived for the federal government to use it against federal law.” The party would amend the Criminal Code to prevent the Jordan ruling from being invoked in cases of serious crimes. It would reinstate minimum sentences for crimes committed with firearms, while allowing judges to make exceptions at their discretion and with cause. The party also wants to create a registry for criminal organizations and would table a bill to crack down on child luring. Using elements of Bill C-63 and Bill S-210, to tackle child pornography, the party would table a bill to make platforms responsible for the content they host. It seeks to impose a time limit on the federal government to fill judicial vacancies. The Bloc would modify the Criminal Code to eliminate the allowance of hate speech when it is based on religious expression.  It would expand the powers of the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise to punish Canadian companies for crimes committed abroad, namely in the mining and diamond industries. The party would work to define “transnational repression” in the Criminal Code to prevent states from monitoring, intimidating and repatriating dissidents. 
Green

The Green Party would change the law to make online platforms legally responsible for all content they publish. It would strengthen laws against hate speech and hate groups and fund community programs that fight discrimination. Greens would “combat racist practices in policing and law enforcement” and “fix discriminatory practices” in public services. They would re-examine the Criminal Code's sections on treason and sedition to protect Canadians against "attempts to advocate or manufacture consent in favour of annexation under the duress of economic warfare." 
People's Party

It would repeal both Bill C-4, which criminalizes conversion therapy practices, and Bill C-16, which added gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination. It would amend Section 34 of the Criminal Code to bolster the right to self-defence and increase the burden of proof necessary to charge and convict victims who used force to defend themselves against a violent attacker. It would amend the Criminal Code to remove pepper spray from the list of prohibited weapons and make it legal to carry for self-defence. It would amend Section 35 of the Criminal Code to include a castle doctrine, which would allow people to use force, including lethal force, to defend themselves against an intruder and not face prosecution. 
Defence
Liberal

The Liberals would aim to increase NATO defence spending to two per cent of Canada’s GDP by 2030. They would review Canada's contract for U.S.-built F-35 fighter jets and partner with allies for the next generation of aircraft. They would invest $420 million to protect sovereignty in the Arctic. They would modernize procurement legislation and create a standalone defence procurement agency to streamline the way equipment is bought for the Canadian Armed Forces. It is unclear whether the Liberals will keep the $1.3-billion border security plan announced in December, which promises to increase drones and enhance aquatic and aerial surveillance in the Arctic as well as at the U.S. border. 
Conservative

The Conservatives would reinforce the military and commit to the NATO spending target for member nations (two per cent of gross domestic product). They say “extra revenue from expanded trade with the U.S.” would go to the Armed Forces. They say they would double the size of the 1st Patrol Group of the Canadian Rangers from 2,000 to 4,000 rangers. They would acquire two additional polar icebreakers for the Royal Canadian Navy and deliver the two polar icebreakers currently being built for the Coast Guard by 2029. They would build at least one permanent Arctic military base within two years. 
New Democrat

New Democrats would increase defence spending to two per cent of Canada’s GDP by 2032. They would cancel the contracts for U.S.-built F-35 fighter jets and P-8 Poseidon aircraft. They would establish new marine search and rescue stations — including in central Nunavut — and build new small craft harbours. They would attempt to re-establish a full-time military base in Inuvik, N.W.T., set up a base in Iqaluit as well as a new CAF Reserve Unit in Whitehorse. They would aim to complete construction of a deep-water port in Nanisivik, Nunavut. They would also work with Indigenous communities and the territorial government to establish more deep-water ports, including in Qikiqtarjuaq and Grays Bay.
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc wants Canada to hit the NATO goal of two per cent of GDP for military spending before the end of the next legislature. It would invest in Quebec technologies and prioritize partnerships with allies for procurement. It says the federal government should obtain the source code for F-35 fighter jets or end its contract. The party wants to strengthen sovereignty in the Arctic with the help of Quebec-based shipbuilder Davie. The Bloc wants the federal government to support the creation of a global shipbuilding hub in the St. Lawrence Valley. It would call on the federal government to implement the foreign agents registry. 
Green

The Greens have not committed to meeting the NATO defence spending target of two per cent of Canada’s GDP by 2032. They would suspend the contract for U.S.-built F-35 fighter jets and consider acquiring French Rafale or Swedish Gripen fighters instead and secure production and maintenance jobs in Canada. They would increase domestic artillery and ammunition production and boost investments to create ammunition reserves. They would join the Norwegian-German Type 212CD submarine development process. They would strengthen Arctic and coastal security with more patrols and better equipment. They would revise the Canadian Military Doctrine to account for the U.S. threatening Canadian sovereignty. They would stop selling weapons to countries that "abuse human rights." The party would create a 120,000-member National Civil Defence Corps to strengthen Canada’s sovereignty, create jobs and prepare for national emergencies. They would expand Canada’s reserve forces by 20,000 members. They would increase funding for Canadian Rangers and local defence initiatives led by Inuit, Dene, Gwich’in, and other Indigenous nations to strengthen Arctic sovereignty.
People's Party

It would prioritize relations with the U.S. for our defence. 
Foreign policy
Liberal

The Liberals would try to strengthen ties with allies that share Canada's values. The party is promising a new “full foreign policy” that would see more officials sent abroad to expand trade and diplomatic activities. They would impose sanctions on Russia to push for a ceasefire with Ukraine. The Liberals are promising to maintain the foreign aid budget at $800 million per year, focusing on programs related to reproductive health, 2SLGBTQ+ issues and climate.
Conservative

The Conservatives would slash foreign aid and divert the money to Canada's military. They would support Ukraine by selling Canadian oil from proposed pipeline projects like Energy East, which TransCanada cancelled in 2017. They want Ukraine to be part of all peace negotiations related to the war. The party is against having Russia join the G7.
New Democrat

New Democrats would aim to contribute 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid and invest in the foreign service. They would create a 500-member Quick Reaction Force, which would be ready to deploy in UN peacekeeping missions. They would ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The NDP says it would recognize a Palestinian state.
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc supports Ukrainian sovereignty. It would allocate up to 0.7 per cent of Canada's gross national income for foreign aid and prioritize supporting education, health, climate change adaptation and shrinking poverty. It would want Canada to contribute more to support international organizations, such as the World Health Organization, to compensate for the cuts of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. It would prioritize relationships with French-speaking nations, especially those in Africa.
Green

The Greens would support Ukraine by "demonstrating economic and moral support." They would stop selling weapons to countries that abuse human rights. They would support the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice. The party would recognize a Palestinian state. They would offer the UN an alternative headquarters in Canada. They want to form a coalition with European and Pacific allies to boost funding for places and programs that the USAID is no longer serving, in light of funding cuts by the Trump administration.
People's Party

It would not get involved in foreign conflicts such as the war in Ukraine, "unless we have a compelling strategic interest in doing so." It would withdraw from all UN commitments (including Sustainable Development Goals, the Global Compact on Migration and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change) and reduce Canada’s presence in UN institutions. It would phase out development aid and focus Canadian international assistance exclusively on emergency humanitarian action "in cases such as health crises, major conflicts and natural disasters." It would liberalize trade with as many countries as possible. To ensure “prosperity and security,” the party says it would prioritize relations with the U.S.
Government spending
Liberal

The Liberals would shrink public spending. They would cap the size of the public service and attempt to make government operations more efficient by "leveraging AI and machine learning." They would aim to balance the government's operational spending within three years, while running a "small deficit" on capital spending. They would provide an initial $150-million annual funding increase to CBC/Radio-Canada. 
Conservative

Conservatives would cut government support for businesses and foreign aid. They plan to defund the CBC but maintain Radio-Canada. They would also boost the local journalism initiative by $25 million. They would cut the federal public service and have called for public servants to be given clear assignments and be monitored to ensure they're completing tasks. The Conservatives don’t plan “big changes” to the equalization program. The party would introduce a “dollar-for-dollar” law, requiring the government to find a dollar of savings for every new dollar spent. It would eliminate university degree requirements for most federal public service jobs.
New Democrat

To increase government revenue, the party would eliminate bearer shares that hide stock ownership and boost compliance funding to Canada Revenue Agency's enforcement section dealing with international and corporate taxation. The party says it would strive toward balancing the budget — aiming to have a falling debt-GDP ratio within four years — but would be willing to borrow “when required” to support Canadian families. The party is promising a “path” to balance the budget once the U.S. trade war is resolved.
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc is against the federal government imposing conditions on transfers to provinces. It would ask the federal government to transfer oversight of the public dental care program to Quebec.


 
Green

The party has yet to share its campaign promises on this issue. 
People's Party

It would set up a department of government downsizing. It would eliminate targeted tax measures that are "inefficient and serve no compelling public policy purpose." It promises to eliminate the deficit by the end of the first mandate, and says it would accomplish this by reducing government support to corporations, including the CBC/Radio-Canada. It would cut foreign development aid, equalization payments and funding for programs that are under provincial or municipal jurisdiction.
Guns
Liberal

A Liberal-led government would revive the gun-buyback program for assault-style firearms. It would automatically revoke gun licences for individuals convicted of violent offences, especially intimate partner violence. The Liberals would legislate a requirement for the RCMP to classify new firearm models entering the market, instead of the gun industry. They would increase funding for the RCMP’s National Forensic Laboratory Services and the Saskatchewan Ballistics Laboratory to better track down guns used in crimes. To strengthen the enforcement of yellow and red flag requirements, the Liberals would bolster the capacity of provincial chief firearms officers. 
Conservative

A Conservative-led government would reverse the Liberals’ gun-buyback program. It would add at least 2,000 border agents, extend powers of the Canada Border Services Agency along the entire border and install surveillance towers, as well as truck-mounted drone systems to spot unauthorized crossings and prevent gun trafficking. To intercept car thefts as well as gun and drug trafficking, the Conservatives would install high-powered scanners at all major land crossings and shipping ports. 
New Democrat

An NDP-led government would hire back at least 1,100 border officers to stop the illegal flow of firearms into Canada. 
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc would continue calling for better control of illegal firearms while ensuring that laws don’t restrict the rights of hunters or the sport hunting industry. 
Green

The Greens would increase Canada Border Services Agency and Canadian Armed Forces patrols and surveillance at the border to prevent the entry of illegal firearms, drugs and other threats from the U.S., and dissuade human trackers from exposing vulnerable people to dangerous crossings. 
People's Party

The party would replace the Firearms Act and supporting legislation. It would eliminate the licensing system with a lifetime certification system for firearms owners who would undergo mandatory vetting, safety training and testing. It would legalize simple possession of firearms for “certified Canadians,” as long as they don’t commit crimes that would disqualify them from firearms ownership. It would reclassify all firearms based on the simplified classification system proposed by the Canadian Shooting Sports Association. It would repeal Bill C-71, which forces retailers to keep records of firearms sales, and Bill C-21, which codified the national handgun freeze into law and added new offences around unlawfully manufactured firearms. It would mandate that all future changes to firearms regulation be made only by Parliament. 
Health care
Liberal

The Liberals have expanded eligibility for dental care to include coverage for those 18 to 64. As for pharmacare, the party has committed to “keeping what is in place,” such as ensuring coverage for diabetes medication and contraception. It announced $52 million in funding for 16 projects across Canada through the Foreign Credential Recognition Program, which would allow internationally trained professionals to get jobs in the health-care network and construction.  They say they will commit $4 billion to construct and renovate community health care infrastructure. The party is promising to make a permanent reproductive health fund and invest in postpartum maternal health research. It is also promising a permanent care fund aimed at providing mental health services for young Canadians.
Conservative

Conservatives would abolish supervised consumption sites and promote recovery and rehab. They would be open to imposing mandatory drug treatment on minors and prisoners “when they are found to be incapable of making decisions for themselves." The party said that under a Conservative government, Canadians who have access to existing federal dental care, child care and pharma care programs would not lose those services. The party has proposed developing a new national standards system that would allow qualified doctors and nurses to work in any province or territory in the country. It also proposes reforming the disability and caregiver tax credits.
New Democrat

The NDP would strengthen public universal health care by expanding pharmacare, dental care and mental health support for Canadians. The party plans on delivering full public pharmacare within four years, starting with 100 of the most prescribed medications, such as pain medication, antibiotics and antipsychotics at estimated cost of $3.5 billion. It would ban U.S. companies from buying Canadian health-care businesses. It would enforce the Canada Health Act to end privatization of health care and require provinces seeking federal funding to uphold public health-care standards. The party has pledged to hire 35,000 new nurses by 2030 and would streamline the path for U.S. and internationally educated nurses. The NDP would make health-care transfers from the federal government to the provinces conditional on their nurse-to-patient ratios and their compensation offers. The party also promises to cover mental health services for those not covered by private insurance plans.
Bloc Québécois

To counter the ongoing health-care crisis, the Bloc would push for an increase in federal health transfers to cover 35 per cent of Quebec’s health-care costs. The party would table a bill to amend the Criminal Code and allow people with an illness that will prevent them from consenting to make an advance request for medical assistance in dying (MAID) for provinces that already authorized the process. 
Green

The party would bolster public health care by expanding health insurance coverage, including mental health care. It would make “medication free for everyone” through universal health care. It would train and hire more health-care workers to improve wait times and expand home care and community care. It promises to improve access to reproductive health care and protect 2SLGBTQ+ rights and access to gender-affirming health care. 
People's Party

It would repeal the Canada Health Act and enable provinces and territories to set up mixed private-public universal systems and become fully responsible for health-care funding and management. It wants to replace the Canada Health transfer cash payments with a “permanent transfer of tax points of equivalent value.” The party would table a bill to restrict abortions after the first trimester and only permit late-term abortions in exceptional circumstances. It would amend the Criminal Code to outlaw the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical procedures for transgender minors seeking gender-affirming care. It would abolish federal health-care plans covering gender-affirming care for federal employees. It would repeal both Bill C-4, which criminalizes conversion therapy practices, and Bill C-16, which added gender identity and gender expression to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination. 
Housing
Liberal

In addition to eliminating GST for first-time homebuyers on new and majorly renovated homes under $1 million, they would create a standalone entity that would act as a developer overseeing the construction of affordable housing in Canada. That entity would supply $25 billion in debt financing and $1 billion in equity financing to "innovative Canadian prefabricated home builders." The Liberals would invest almost $74 million to improve critical housing infrastructure, speed up housing development and help meet the growing demand for affordable housing in the North. They would invest almost $66 million to build, renovate and repair hundreds more homes across Nunavut, including for Indigenous Peoples and underserved groups.  The Liberals are promising a standalone agency called Build Canada Homes that will act as a developer, overseeing the construction of affordable housing in Canada.
Conservative

The Conservatives would cut the GST on new homes up to $1.3 million. They say the GST measure will cost between $3.96 billion and $4.97 billion. They would tie federal funding to cities to the number of housing starts. Cities or municipalities would be expected to increase the number of homes they build by 15 per cent each year; they would offer bonuses to municipalities that surpass that target. For every dollar of development taxes cut, a Conservative-led government would match that amount to a maximum of $25,000 per home, for a total possible savings of $50,000. It would sell off 15 per cent of federally owned buildings so the land can be used to build affordable homes. It would implement a NIMBY (not in my backyard) fine on municipalities that block construction because of "egregious" opposition from local residents. 
New Democrat

The NDP would put in place a $16-billion strategy to support building affordable homes. They would replace the housing accelerator fund with permanent funding for two new programs: the Canadian homes transfer and the communities first fund. The party is aiming to build three million affordable homes in the next five years. They would redesign and double the Public Land Acquisition Fund, investing $1 billion over five years to build more rent-controlled homes. They would set aside all suitable federal Crown land in order to build more than 100,000 rent-controlled homes by 2035. They would speed up approvals on lands owned by the federal government to build homes sooner. They also say they would require the CMHC to offer low-interest, public-backed mortgages. The New Democrats are promising more money for the Rental Protection Fund — a federal program that supports community housing projects. They say they would ban corporate landlords from buying existing affordable rental properties and stop providing them with low-interest federal loans and mortgage loan insurance if they gouge tenants. They would “rescue at-risk home-building projects impacted by tariffs,” with the aim of stabilizing housing markets and creating jobs in construction.
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc wants the $1.2 billion from the Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund to be transferred to Quebec without conditions and integrate the funding to an existing program or use it for a new one that would better serve municipalities. The party is in favour of a GST rebate on new homes for first-time homebuyers and wants to eliminate the GST for services related to the purchase of a first home, such as building inspections. 
Green

The Greens have pledged to triple Canada’s social housing stock over the next seven years by building 1.2 million permanently affordable homes. They would mandate the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to establish five regional prefabricated housing plants to mass-produce affordable housing and would remove GST from all affordable rental housing development. The party would also require that the cost of federally funded housing be capped at 30 per cent of household income. Long-term, low-interest loans would be provided to nonprofits, co-operatives and public housing agencies. The Green Party plans to stop corporations from buying single-family homes. They would use covenants to ensure housing built with public money stays affordable "forever." They want to close loopholes to prevent the use of real estate for money laundering. They would eliminate unfair tax advantages for real estate investment trusts (REITs). They would push for the creation of intergenerational co-housing. The party would also require all provinces and territories to impose strong rent and vacancy controls. The Greens have also pledged to support Indigenous-led housing by transferring federal land to community-driven housing solutions. The party has committed to expanding federal funding for youth shelters and transitional housing.
People's Party

They would designate areas as "shovel-ready" zones to accelerate the construction of a liquefied natural gas project in Quebec. They would repeal the federal government's Impact Assessment Act (C-69), which allows federal regulators to consider the potential environmental and social impacts of various resource and infrastructure projects.

They would favour Canadian companies in the bid selection process, as well as suppliers and contractors with a unionized workforce. 
Bloc Québécois

The Bloc supports a high-speed rail system that would connect Quebec City to Toronto. It is against the nuclear waste disposal project in Chalk River as well as an Energy East pipeline, which would impact Quebec ecosystems.

Conservative

The Conservatives would reinstate apprenticeship grants of up to $4,000. They would fund training halls to help develop 350,000 workers over five years by expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program. They say smaller unions would also have equal access to funding that covers up to 75 per cent of the costs of building and running those programs. The party would allow union training centres and colleges to pre-register apprentices for EI, with the aim of creating a “special class of rapid EI payout for skilled tradespeople.” The Conservatives say they would work with provinces to “harmonize health and safety regulations” so tradespeople can work anywhere in Canada without having to repeat training.

Conservative

The party would continue to impose counter-tariffs until the U.S. removes all of its tariffs.

The party would cut GST from the sale of new Canadian-made cars as long as Trump’s tariffs are in place. Conservatives have pledged to create a "Keep Canadians Working Fund," a temporary loan and credit program that would provide up to $3 billion in short-term credit lines and low-interest loans for affected businesses. Conservatives promise to renegotiate a softwood lumber agreement with the U.S. The party would pursue a free trade and mobility agreement with the U.K., Australia and New Zealand.
New Democrat

New Democrats are in favour of retaliatory tariffs.

The party would table a bill to protect supply management and Quebec farmers in future trade agreements. It would table a bill to guarantee local purchasing and reserve a percentage of Canadian content in public contracts and federal procurement, similar to the Buy American Act. It would maintain the digital service tax, which requires foreign and domestic large businesses to pay on certain revenue earned from engaging with online users in Canada if they meet certain conditions. The party would table a bill requiring the House of Commons to vote on a preliminary text of a free trade agreement before it is adopted.
Green

The Greens would work to ally with other democracies to create joint retaliatory economic measures against the U.S. They would bar U.S. President Donald Trump from the G7 summit in June.
